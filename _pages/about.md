I am a Ph.D. student at [Mila-Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), and [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/), specializing in computational neuroscience, brain-inspired AI, reinforcement learning, and multimodal large language models. I focus on understanding and improving existing algorithms while developing new AI solutions with real-world impact. I am particularly interested in using AI to understand brain function and behavior, with the goal of building intelligent systems that enhance human capabilities. I enjoy working within diverse and multi-disciplinary teams and often draw inspirations from neuroscience and psychology while developing algorithmic solutions.

My research receives generous support from [Fonds de recherche du Québec](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/nature-and-technologies/) and [Unifying Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence - Québec](https://www.unique.quebec/) scholarships.

Before starting my Ph.D. program, I was an undergraduate student in the Psychology Department at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/)([Ankara, Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara)), where I conducted research on computational neuroscience and psychology at [Aysel Sabuncu Brain Research Center (UMRAM)](https://umram.bilkent.edu.tr/).

When I am not doing research, you will find me exploring new activities, experimenting with a variety of cultural dishes in the kitchen, and jamming on my bass guitar.
