I am a Ph.D. student at [Mila-Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), and [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/). My research intrest broadly includes reinforcement learning and neuroscience. I aim to deepen our understanding of existing algorithms and develop new ones to have a positive impact on society through real-world applications. I am fascinated by the potential applications of AI in unraveling the complexities  of the brain and behavior, with the aim of contributing to or enhancing human capabilities.  I enjoy working within diverse and multi-disciplinary teams and often draw inspirations from neuroscience and psychology while developing algorithmic solutions.

My research receives generous support from [Fonds de recherche du Québec](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/nature-and-technologies/) and [Unifying Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence - Québec](https://www.unique.quebec/) scholarships.

Before starting my Ph.D. program, I was an undergraduate student in the Psychology Department at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/)([Ankara, Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara)), where I conducted research on computational neuroscience and psychology at [Aysel Sabuncu Brain Research Center (UMRAM)](https://umram.bilkent.edu.tr/).

When I am not doing research, you will find me exploring new activities, experimenting with a variety of cultural dishes in the kitchen, and jamming on my bass guitar.
